# todo
This todo list was created using html, css, and vanilla javascript to satisfy the requirements of https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list. The project uses webpack to bundle js modules and manage dependencies, and can be built by running "npm run build". Firebase is used to provide cloud storage for the user's todo item database.
